Yes, the above implementation includes a hash table with both chaining and linear probing solutions to collisions. The `HashTable` class has two `insert functions`: `insert_with_chaining` and `insert_with_linear_probing`. The `insert_with_chaining` function uses chaining to handle collisions, while the `insert_with_linear_probing` function uses linear probing. Additionally, the `HashTable `class keeps track of the total number of collisions for each insertion method (`chain_collisions` and `linear_collisions` variables), which are printed out at the end of the program.
